<h3> <font size="15"> His Statement: </font></h3>
<h2>
Hello, my name is Marc Velayo- a third year student at San Jose State University. I am an artist who ventures to different kinds of art medium-- both traditional and digital.

</h2>

<h2>I am a big supporter of innovation-- especially with Technology. I cannot live through my day, without checking my smartphone. This technological advancement-- commonly
used for communication and enterntainment has evolved throughout the years. It has improved lives, and has also caused destruction.
</h2>
<h2>
This semester, I wanted to focus solely on smartphones-- mainly the usage of Social Media.  Social Media, like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter are being used by millions of people
around the world. These applications focus on communication, interaction and entertainment. With all the advantages that surrounds these applications-- people forget about the
disadvatages that comes with it.
</h2>
<h2>Some people don't think before they post. People share fake information, rumors and things that affects other people's lives. Some people just stay home, and stay online
  the whole entire day. Distraction is one of the disadvantages that these smartphones bring. Distraction from doing responsibilities-- some people are distracted while doing work,
  while studying and while doing their everyday routine. Technology is heavily immersed in today's society, and has impacted everyone's lives in a heartbeat.
</h2>
<h2>My projects are based on these disadvantages-- from the stolen reality, mental health issues caused by its usage, cyberbullying to even death. These problems are happening every single day,
  and it's up to us if we will stop it, or still continue this habit. </h3>
