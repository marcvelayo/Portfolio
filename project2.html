<h3> <b> <u> Hello, My Name Is Anxiety, Digital Video, 3:07min, Vimeo </b> </u></h3>

<h3>
Mental health is one of the things that our society needs to prioritize. We encounter various individuals everyday, and we can never tell what's going on with their lives. </h3>
<h3>Emotions are hard to express especially if one's vulnerability is on the line. This video will be tackling the stigma surrounding mental health, mainly anxiety.</h3>
<h3>
It features Mika Manalastas, a close friend who's going through this mental disorder. How does she cope with it? How does she express it? </h3>
<h3>
This video interacts with reality and technology.
Social Media is one of the platforms that our society uses today for expression. It's a helpful tool but to what extent?
